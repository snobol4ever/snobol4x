% Brown, Clark, Jones, and Smith are the names of the men who hold, though not
% necessarily respectively, the positions of accountant, cashier, manager, and
% president in the First National Bank of Fairport.  Although the cashier beats
% him consistently, the president will play chess with no one else in the bank.
% Both the manager and the cashier are better chess players than the accountant.
% Jones and Smith are nextdoor neighbors and frequently play chess together in
% the evening.  Clark plays a better game of chess than Jones.  The accountant
% lives near the president but not near any of the others.  What position does
% each man hold?
