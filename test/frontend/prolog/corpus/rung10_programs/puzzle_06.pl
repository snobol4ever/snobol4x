% Clark, Jones, Morgan, and Smith are four men whose occupation are butcher,
% druggist, grocer, and policeman, though not necessarily respectively.  Clark
% and Jones are neighbors and take turns driving each other to work.  Jones
% makes more money than Morgan.  Clark beats Smith regularly at bowling.  The
% butcher always walks to work.  The policeman does not not live near the
% druggist.  The only time the grocer and the policeman ever met was when the
% policeman arrested the grocer for speeding.  The policeman makes more money
% than the druggist or the grocer.  What is each man's occupation?
